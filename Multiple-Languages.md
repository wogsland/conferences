#Learning Multiple Languages: Polyamory or Serial Monogamy?#

We all have our first love, that language we fell in love with programming learning. But at some point we all move on and learn another. For me I started in Java, moved into C++ and then SQL. I was a serial monogamist of languages. But then I got into web development, PHP - SQL - JavaScript, and I embraced multiple loves. This talk will discuss the advantages/disadvantages of the two approaches and the value add of learning multiple languages however one goes about it.

# CoNfErEnCeS #

I want to get better at submitting CFPs.

By better I mean actually have them accepted.

I've been submitting them and I have some Google docs scattered about,
but none have really been much of a success. My basic theory with this
repo is that I'm going to have development branches of different talks
and bios until they get accepted and then I'll merge them into the master
branch.
